    <p>Pok√©monverse is an imaginative compilation of NFTs based on the iconic Pok√©mon universe. These digital creatures are procedurally generated and stored as NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. The inaugural generation comprises 10,000 unique Pok√©mon, each featuring diverse attributes such as species, types, colors, and special abilities. These Pok√©mon will be represented with a variety of poses, backgrounds, and themed elements. Some Pok√©mon may possess rare traits, making them more unique and sought after by trainers. Additionally, there are whispers circulating within the Pok√©monverse about the possibility of encountering disguised humans attempting to blend in with these virtual creatures. Is it a mere rumor or an intriguing reality? ü§î</p>

    <h1>What's an NFT?</h1>
    <p>NFT stands for "Non-fungible token," which means that it's a unique, digital item with blockchain-managed ownership that users can buy, own, and trade. Some NFT's fundamental function is to be digital art. But they can also offer additional benefits like exclusive access to websites, event tickets, game items, and ownership records for physical objects. Think of it as a unique piece of art that can also work as a "members-only" card. Robotos works like this.</p>
    <h1>How Do I NFT?</h1>
    <p>New to NFTs? No worries, here are some steps on what you need to do to get your Roboto.</p>
    <p>1. Download the¬†metamask.io¬†extension for the Chrome/Brave browser or app on mobile. This will allow you to make purchases with Ethereum and can be found in the extensions tab. If you are on mobile, you must use the Metamask App Browser</p>
    <p>2. You can purchase Ethereum through the Metamask Wallet using Wyre or Send Ethereum from an exchange like¬†Coinbase.</p> 
    <p>3. Click on¬†Connect¬†at the top of the page and connect your Metamask. Once joined, you will be able to purchase the NFTs in the mint section. You will be prompted to sign your transaction. FYI, there will be a fee associated with every transaction related to gas prices.</p>
    <p>4. Once you have made your purchase, your Roboto NFTs will be viewable in your wallet and on¬†OpenSea.</p>
